* `node['varnish']['vcl_source']` - Name for default configuration file template. (default.vcl)
* `node['varnish']['vcl_cookbook']` - Cookbook in which to look for the default.vcl.erb (or 'vcl_source' filename) template. This is used to specify custom template without modifying community cookbook files. (nil)
* `node['varnish']['secret_file']` - Path to a file containing a secret used for authorizing access to the management port. (/etc/varnish/secret)

* `node['varnish']['ttl']` - Specifies  a hard minimum time to live for cached documents. (120)
* `node['varnish']['min_threads']` - Start at least this many threads (5)

If you don't specify your own vcl_conf file, then these attributes are used in the cookbook `default.vcl` template:

* `node['varnish']['backend_host']` = Host to serve/cache content from (localhost)
* `node['varnish']['backend_port']` = Port on backend host to access (8080)


Recipes
-------
### default
Installs the varnish package, manages the default varnish configuration file, and the init script defaults file.

### apt_repo
If placed before the default recipe in the run list, the official Varnish project apt repository will offer access to more version and platform support.


Usage
-----
On systems that need a high performance caching server, use `recipe[varnish]`. Additional configuration can be done by modifying the `default.vcl.erb` and `ubuntu-default.erb` templates. By default the `custom-default.erb` is set up to run with the varnish defaults, and a simple `default.vcl`.

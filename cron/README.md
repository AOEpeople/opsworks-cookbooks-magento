cron Cookbook
=============
Installs the cron package and starts the crond service.


Requirements
------------
Platforms:
- RHEL family
- Debian family
- Solaris family
- Gentoo


Resources and Providers
-----------------------
### `cron_d`
The `cron_d` LWRP can be used to manage files in `/etc/cron.d`. It supports the same interface as Chef's built-in `cron` resource:

```ruby
cron_d 'daily-usage-report' do
  minute  0
  hour    23
  command '/srv/app/scripts/daily_report'
  user    'appuser'
end
```

Note: This LWRP does not function on Solaris platforms because they do not support running jobs stored in /etc/cron.d.

#### Attributes
* `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `month`, `weekday` - schedule your cron job. These correspond exactly to their equivalents in the crontab file. All default to "*".
* `predefined_value` - schedule your cron job with one of the special predefined value instead of * * * * * pattern. This correspond to @reboot, @yearly, @annually, @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight or @hourly.
* `command` - the command to run. Required.
* `user` - the user to run as. Defaults to "root".
* `mailto`, `path`, `home`, `shell` - set the corresponding environment variables in the cron.d file. No default.

Definitions
-----------
### `cron_control`
The `cron_control` definition can be used to manage the `/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` files.  
Incude this cookbook as dependency to your cookbook and execute the definition as:

The following will add the user mike to the `/etc/cron.allow` file:

```ruby
cron_manage 'mike' do
  user   'mike'
  action :allow
end
```

The following will add the user john to the `/etc/cron.deny` file:

```ruby
cron_manage 'john' do
  user  'john'  #optional, resource name will be used if not specified.
  action :deny  #optional, deny is the default
end
```

#### Attributes
* `user` - username that you want to control (optional).
* `action` - `:allow` or `:deny`. :deny is the default.
